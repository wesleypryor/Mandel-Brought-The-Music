# Mandel-Brought-The-Music
Fractals are objects that represent an evolving and expanding symmetry. Music is complex and diversem but revolves around a unique melody. With similar behavior between fractals and music, the question arises; can fractals generate music? Using fractals such as the Mandelbrot Set, we will calculate the distance between a starting point and the border of the fractal to generate a melody that follows the border of one of these popular geometric oddities.

This project was done in collaboration with [Taylor Hutyra](https://github.com/taylor-hutyra). Presented at the 2018 Texas Section MAA Conference.
